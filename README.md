# LLM-Langchain-Projects

Welcome to **LLM-Langchain-Projects**! This repository hosts two distinct projects that leverage advanced language model technologies. These projects are designed to demonstrate the power of LLMs (Large Language Models) in generating dynamic content and interacting with unstructured data like PDF files.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Blog Generation using Llama 2

This project enables automatic blog content creation based on user-specified topics and word counts. It is an excellent tool for content creators looking to generate initial drafts or gather ideas swiftly.

#### Features
- Generate blog content tailored to specific topics.
- Customize the length of generated content.

#### Technology Stack
- Streamlit
- Llama 2 LLM

#### Setup and Usage
To set up and run the Blog Generation project:
```bash
# Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
git clone <repository-url>
cd LLM-Langchain-Projects/Blog generation using Llama 2

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit application
streamlit run app.py

# Querying PDF using Langchain and AstraDB

The "Querying PDF using Langchain and AstraDB" project is designed to allow users to interactively query any PDF document by asking questions. It leverages a powerful OpenAI language model to analyze and extract information directly from the provided PDF files, enabling a robust, AI-driven approach to understanding document content.

## Features

- **Interactive Query Interface**: Ask questions and get answers extracted from the PDF document.
- **Use of Advanced LLMs**: Utilizes OpenAI's language models for precise and context-aware information extraction.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation
